#calculate reduction in strata-level variance
(0.122-0.0159)/(0.122) # 0.869
#ie. 87% reduction in strata level variance, 13% of intersectional difference is multiplicative

# The question, now, is whether that remaining multiplicative variance is significant. If it isnâ€™t, it would make sense to simplify the model to a single level model, since there is no significant additional variance at level 2. 
# To judge this, we need to run the same model as a single level model, using the lm function

model3 <- lm(capped_daily_grams_log ~ SEX + age_3_cats + race_5_cats + education_3_cats + decade, data=data_intersections_MAIHDA)

# We can then compare the model fit of these two models

anova(model2, model3)

# Model 2 is a significantly better fit than model 3 (i.e. multilevel model is better than single level)

# It would now be useful to plot our residuals to identify which intersectional strata have particularly higher/lower levels of consumption than expected. 
# To do this we will use the REsim command, to produce residuals, and associated confidence intervals, which we can then plot with the plotREsim command. 
# First, we will create a new dataframe with the residuals and uncertainty in them

reEX <- REsim(model1)
plotREsim(reEX, labs=T) + coord_flip()
#these are the overall differences between groups
#note large CIs for some strata 
#This is also why this strata is close to the middle - it has been shrunk in a lot because of its unreliability.

reEX2 <- REsim(model2)
plotREsim(reEX2, labs=T) + coord_flip()
#and these are what remains when additive effects are removed 9i.e. the multiplicative effects
