# About

This is the statistical code for the manuscript: "Lifestyle risk factors  and socioeconomic inequality in mortality: Decomposing differential exposure and vulnerability in the United States" by  Puka, Buckley, Mulia, Lasserre, Rehm, and Probst. 

The data used is publically available from the National Center for Health Statistics.

- The 1997-2014 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) survey are available here: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhis/1997-2018.htm

- The 2015 Public-Use Linked Mortality Files are available here: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data-linkage/mortality-public.htm

The data files were extracted and initially manipuated using SAS. All analyses were completed in R. The SAS and R code are available in this repository. The key variables included in the analyses are listed below.
